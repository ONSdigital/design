## Getting feedback
### 1. Set the context
- who are the users?
- what do they need?
- what stage is the project at?
- what are our current assumptions?
### 2. Say what kind of feedback you want
- graphic design
- interaction design
- service design
- content design
### 3. Let the team review the work
- don't give a demo
- don't talk too much
- don't get defensive
- do take notes
- do listen

## Giving feedback
### 1. Listen to the context
- ask questions if you need to
### 2. Give the right kind of feedback
- avoid personal opinions
- avoid absolute statements
- ask open questions
- be kind
- explore ideas and suggest alternatives

### Bad feedback
- “I don't like X”
- “Y never works”

### Good feedback
- “What happens if…”
- “Have you tried…”
