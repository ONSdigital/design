# Logo

## Header logo
- When a user clicks the header logo, they should be redirected to the home of the current sub-domain
- For example, if they are reading ONS Digital Blog, they should be taken to http://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/
- User research shows that many users aren't aware of this convention, so a clear text link to the home page is also needed
