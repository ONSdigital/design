## Style.ONS
- Style.ONS is a style guide that covers the elements of writing about statistics
- http://style.ons.gov.uk/

## Title tag
- ``Title`` tags should follow this format "Name of page - Name of website"
- For example, "Employment and labour market - Office for National Statistics"

## URL standards
- We follow the [GOV.UK URL standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/url-standards-for-gov-uk)
- Dashes should be used to separate words within URLs so they are easy to read - for example, https://www.gov.uk/running-a-limited-company
