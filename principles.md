# Principles

Draft design principles from the ONS design community.

1. Be inclusive, not exclusive
Everything we build should be inclusive. If you can’t make something inclusive, provide an alternative method of accessing the content.

2. Always put our users and their needs first
Do research, gather metrics, talk to users. Don’t make assumptions, you are not your user. Take time to understand the context of the user needs, what they want isn’t always what they need.

3. But do it better. Justify every pixel on the page.

4. We use research and metrics to inform our design decisions. We design for the medium, with real content.

5. Core functionality and content must be available to all users. We use progressive enhancement to add more elegant features for the latest browsers. We aren’t led by technology.

6. If something doesn’t work then we iterate, and iterate again. Iteration makes big failures unlikely and turns small failures into lessons. We are continuously improving.

7. We should use the same design patterns wherever possible. When this isn’t possible, we should make sure our approach is consistent. We continue to work towards one global style guide.

8. Details are important, but don’t get lost in them, look at the bigger picture. Focus on how to make the whole process as straightforward as possible. Do the hard work now, to make it simple.

9. We should share what we’re doing wherever possible. Share code, share designs, share ideas, share intentions, share failures.
